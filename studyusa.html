            <p class="biotextbottom">In January 2025, I joined a team of student journalists for a week-long Study USA course in New Orleans, focusing on media ethics. We reported on a variety of local issues– from pollution-ridden ‘Cancer Alley’ to the post-terrorist attack Bourbon Street. Guided by professional journalists, public relations experts, grassroots organizers, and our professor Cynthia Joyce, this immersive trip pushed me to report in the field, interview a wide range of voices, and think on my feet.

                <p class="sharontext">In the summer of 2018, Sharon Lavigne, retired special education teacher and grandmother of 12, sat on her porch, watching the light fade over the neighborhood she had called home for all her life, in St James Parish, Louisiana. With developers waiting with baited teeth to turn her block into an industrial behemoth– Lavigne turned to prayer. 
                <br><br>“I asked (God) if I should leave or if I should sell my land or sell my home,” Lavigne said. “He told me no. He told me to fight,” Lavigne said.

            <p class="rise">This moment of divine epiphany became the foundation of Lavigne’s mission. She founded RISE St. James, a grassroots organization that mobilizes residents to oppose the construction of industrial facilities in their predominantly Black community. <br><br>The St. James Parish lies in an 85-mile stretch of land infamously known as “Cancer Alley.” With over 200 petrochemical plants–from plastics manufactures to oil refiners– this region has more facilities than any other parts of the country according to IBISWorld, a market research database. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="paragraph">This intense chemical production is not without consequence, especially to its residents, who live within a 1-mile radius of the plants. According to a study by Keele University, the risk of cancer in Cancer Alley is 95% higher than the rest of the United States. A 2024 report published by IOP Science, a digital science journal, rates of low birthweight were as high as 27%, which is more than double the state average of 11.3%. The Formosa plant, a proposed $9.4 billion petrochemical complex, was slated for a census tract where 90% of the population was Black, compared to roughly 50% in the overall parish, reported by the Environmental Protection Agency in 2022. The pollution disproportionately impacts predominantly Black neighborhoods, where 85% of the reported air pollution in St. James Parish originates, according to The Chemical and Engineering News.

            <p class="paragraph">While the industry claims it brings economic prosperity, from 2010 to 2022, the petroleum industry received a $19 million first-year tax credit, but created no new direct jobs in that period for Louisianans, according to Invest in Louisiana, a budget project for the state. 

In September 2022, a state judge shut down 15 air permits from the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality for a proposed industrial complex, blocking a facility that could have emitted over 800 tons of toxic pollution annually in the Saint James Parish. 

Faith has become a key part of resistance in Cancer Alley. </p>

            <p class="cacaption">Pastor Joseph (middle), Brian Moore (right), and reproter Mary Evans at Cancer Alley, taken by Olivia Quin Jan. 2025.</p>
            <p class="paragraph"> “It might be faith, it might be radical hope,” said Brian Moore, Program Coordinator for the Louisiana Bucket Brigade, a nonprofit that aism to mobilize communities in Louisiana affected by the petrochemical industry. “But you need something burning within you to stop these (companies) and get justice for your community.” Faith-based organizations have been instrumental to justice movements for a long time, from the Civil Rights Movement to modern day protests– Cancer Alley is no exception.<br><br>

“A lot of times, those community meetings take place in churches… maybe the mission of these community partners doesn’t mention faith, but certainly faith does play a big part in the lives of these people,” Moore said.<br><br>

Moore compares this struggle to the Biblical story of David and Goliath. “We are not David in this story… we are the sling and the rocks they use to hurl at Goliath,” he said. 

<br><br>One of those “Davids” is Reverend Harry Joseph, pastor of the 114-year-old Mount Triumph Baptist Church in St. James Parish. 

<br><br>“Pastor Joseph’s faith is really important to him and how he approaches the fight,” Moore said. 

<br><br>Known as Pastor Joseph, he founded Rural Roots Louisiana, a family led organization focused on activism and education about the dangers of petrochemical pollution. 

<br><br>“The Bible tells us that when God created everything, he created everything good. He gave us clean water, he gave us clean soil and he gave us clean air. So if God gave that to us, we should fight to keep it,” Joseph said. 

<br><br>Joseph’s church is deeply involved in the community. 

<br><br>“My little church is very active in that community,” Joseph said. “I try to educate people in our community as to what’s going on and to the chemicals they’re breathing in.”

<br><br>Christianity has been the dominant religion in the Saint James Parish since its colonization. In 2020, the Roman Catholics numbered at 19,342, while the National Baptist Convention of the U.S., had 2,180 members, according to the Association of Religion Data Archives. This number makes up the majority of the 22, 052 population of the parish, at the time, according to USA Facts.  

<br><br>Like Lavigne, Joseph sees his efforts as a moral obligation, required by God.

<br><br>“My strength comes from God. I can’t do nothin’ without him,” Joseph said.
